# Loan-Repayment-Prediction-and-Borrower-Risk-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project applies supervised machine learning to predict loan repayment amounts and classify borrower default risk using real-world financial data. Multiple regression and classification models were built, evaluated, and compared using metrics like RMSE, accuracy, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation.
